### 🧑‍💻 About Me

Miftahul Abedin Sifat
I am a passionate Computer Science and Technology student, currently in my second year of study. With one year of hands-on experience in web development, I have been involved in designing and developing websites using the MERN Stack for course assignments and projects. Alongside my studies, I am also working as a freelancer, enhancing my skills and gaining valuable experience in various areas of web development. I am now looking for a web development job to further improve my expertise and contribute to real-world projects. Outside of my professional and academic life, I enjoy spending time with friends and indulging in recreational activities like playing games.
